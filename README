This is a filetree to support the experimental Zoo RDFa profile.

Zoo is a collection of wild RDF vocabularies, with minimal integration such
that they can be deployed as a single RDFa profile.

The main activity here is investigating the cases where the exact same 
term name has been used in different vocabularies. At this stage no other
form of integration has been explored.

Contents: 

Software: some Perl scripts and CPAN libraries, also use is made of 
Redland/Raptor for double-checking parser results.

* master.txt - hand-maintained list of vocabularies, prefixes, and tags.
* 'harvest.pl' script, which fetches RDF from vocabs tagged 'zoo' in master.txt.
* 'terms' script, reads master.txt and data/*.rdf, generates raw_manifest.txt
* raw_manifest.txt - list of terms and clashes
* curated_manifest.txt - with extra tags indicating selections for Zoo

zoo.foaf.tv/ 
  ... corresponds to the Web site. Will be largely script generated.

Todo: we have everything almost that is needed, except final generation of index.html.
